            <section id="section-1">
            Equine massage is the use of hands, arms, elbows and/or tools to
            rub and knead the muscles of the horse's body to decrease
            tension and/or pain. Equine massage utilizes modified human
            massage techniques on horses to help them perform better and
            decrease pain associated with training, an ill fitting saddle,
            an unbalanced rider or injury.
